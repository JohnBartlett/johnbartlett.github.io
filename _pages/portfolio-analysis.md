# Portfolio Analysis

## Overview

This page documents the comprehensive mapping of John Bartlett's GitHub projects (32 repositories, analyzed from 2023â€“2025). The analysis covered project purposes, stacks, activity, README quality, and technical debt to provide a complete picture of the development portfolio.

The portfolio analysis revealed insights into project distribution, technology adoption patterns, and development activity trends across multiple years of work.

## Systems and Code-Generation Tools

The portfolio mapping utilized a sophisticated toolchain for comprehensive analysis:

- **GitHub CLI (`gh`)** for exporting repository metadata and commit history
- **Python scripts** (`enrich.py`, `signals.py`) for enrichment, stack detection, and signals extraction
- **PowerShell scripts** for CSV exports, commit timelines, and report assembly
- **Code generation assistance** via ChatGPT for prompt-driven development of enrichment and analysis scripts
- **Integration environments** including Cursor, Replit, and Comet for streamlined coding workflows

This multi-tool approach enabled automated data collection, intelligent analysis, and comprehensive reporting across the entire portfolio.

## Technology Stacks Detected

The analysis identified diverse technology stacks across the 32 repositories:

- **Node.js / React / TypeScript** (most frequent stack)
- **Python** (data science and automation repositories)
- **Docker** (infrastructure and containerization projects)
- **iOS** (experimental mobile development)
- **Development environment markers** for Cursor, Replit, and Comet integration

The stack analysis revealed a balanced approach to technology adoption, with strong representation across web development, data science, and infrastructure domains.

## Key Outputs

The portfolio analysis generated comprehensive artifacts for project management and strategic planning:

- **`repos_summary.csv`**: Complete metadata for all repositories
- **`signals_summary.csv`**: Stack detection, markers, and technical debt analysis
- **`platform_projects.csv`**: Cursor/Replit/Comet-linked repositories
- **`active_projects.csv`** vs **`stale_projects.csv`**: Activity-based project triage
- **`missing_readme.csv`**: Repositories requiring documentation improvements
- **`timeline_coarse.csv`** and **`timeline_monthly.csv`**: Project activity over time
- **`portfolio_report.md`**: Executive summary with strategic recommendations

These outputs provide actionable insights for portfolio optimization and strategic development planning.

## Recommendations

The comprehensive analysis produced strategic recommendations to optimize the development portfolio:

- **Showcase active, well-documented, low-debt projects** for maximum professional impact
- **Revive stale but meaningful projects** that align with current strategic goals
- **Archive empty or duplicative repositories** to reduce maintenance overhead and improve portfolio clarity

These recommendations support strategic portfolio management and professional development optimization.
